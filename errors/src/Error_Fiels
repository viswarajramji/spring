port blocked by 8005 
solution:
Check if port 8005 is really in use by Windows :

Install and run Sysinternals TCPView and Check if the line with "Local Port" 8005 has as "Process" System

Or check the file c:\Windows\CCM\Logs\DeltaDownload.log for port 8005

If the port is in use by system, go to Computer Management and stop the service "SMS Agent Host" or open a command prompt as administrator and type: sc stop CcmExec
